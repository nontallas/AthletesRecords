# AthletesRecords repository
This is a small, easy expandable project using Java and MySQL.
With this application you can retrieve data from the DB by selecting the content you want to see on your screen.

The DB contains data from various timed events of athletes, and someone can access them via pre-built queries, like a Top 5, the record holder and the personal best of every athlete.
